## (setq hello-world t) 👋🏼

Hej from Stockholm, Sweden! I’m Mark, a Mathematics educator with over 18 years experience who has a deep passion for programming and web development. As a Lindewood University alumni, I bring a dynamic approach to learning, integrating Backward Lesson Design, Computational Thinking, and Threshold Concepts into my teaching practice.

## 🔥 My Teaching Arsenal:
- **Doom Emacs:** My preferred tool for programming and note-taking.
- **GitHub:** Collaboratively developing and sharing educational resources with students and educators alike.
- **Languages:** LaTeX, Python, Swift, with a sprinkle of Emacs Lisp (Elisp) and JavaScript.

## 🎯 Current Endeavors:
- Porting over 5,000 notes from Org-roam to Emacs Denote, developing a robust file naming schema and ID system in the process.
- Creating modularly written notes and solutions designed for flexible use in exams, worksheets, slides, and notebooks powered by python and LaTeX.
- Focusing on improving my Emacs Lisp (Elisp) skills to spice up my emacs config.
